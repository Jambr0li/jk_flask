Today I read a study about concentrative vs mindfulness meditation practices and how they effect our preception of time. <br><br>
Concentrative meditation is when you focus on a single stimulus, such as the breath, a visual, or a mantra. 
Mindfulness meditation is an open awareness where you observe different stimuli as they occur. 
So in concentrative meditation your attention is fixed whereas in mindfulness it is constantly switching between different stimuli.\*<br><br> 
Time was percieved as going by *faster* when doing the concentrative practice and *slower* when doing the mindfulness practice.
When doing a mindfulness practice, the constant switching of attention between different stimuli becomes a memory of events that you can remember. 
This results in a feeling of time being slower, because you have the perception that more happened. 
In contrast, when doing a concentrative practice, the object of the practice is to focus solely on one thing to such an extent that the normal chattering of your mind goes quiet.
As a result, the memory of events is very sparse and you don't register the passage of time as noticeably.

*this is just an overview, there are many variations within each category.
