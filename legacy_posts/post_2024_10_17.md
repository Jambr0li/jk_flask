I first implemented a <code>scapegoat tree</code> and then I tried to repurpose my code in order to also implement an <code>AVL tree</code>. This didn't work out very well because of the non-recurive method I used to implement the scapegoat tree. <br>
I ended up re-writing a lot of code in order to finish this project... I also had a jolly time figuring out the borrowing rules in <code> Rust</code>.  <br>
Here is a picture of me whiteboarding some tree rotations:

<style>
  .responsive-img {
    max-width: 80%;
    max-height: 200px;
  }
</style>
