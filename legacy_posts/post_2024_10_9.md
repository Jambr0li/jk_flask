I've been running early in the morning lately and today it felt extra spooky as I ran in the dark.
As I was running I saw something in the distance under the moonlight and I couldn't tell if it was a small dear or something else like a big dog or a cougar. 
In my head I knew it was probably just a dear but when you are running through the darkness by yourself early in the morning, your mind plays tricks on you. 
The animal went back into the woods before I got close so I wasn't able to tell for sure what it was. For the rest of the run I was warily looking into the woods hoping nothing would jump out at me.
Glad to say I made it.
