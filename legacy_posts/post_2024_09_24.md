Today I added these buttons that will let you sort the blog posts.<br>
At first I had it look through all the posts and find every unique tag, but I decided to manually pick which tags I want to sort on instead.<br>
Because there are so few posts and the posts have multiple tags, it didn't make sense to clutter the site with a bunch of buttons that wouldn't be useful.<br>
Anyway, this site is fun to work on. Flask has been a nice tool to learn. It is simple and easier to grasp than some of the bigger frameworks. I like that I have a better understanding of what is going on.
