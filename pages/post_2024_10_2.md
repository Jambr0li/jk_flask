I've been listening to *A Short History of Nearly Everything* by Bill Bryson. <br>
Every time I hear the scale of the universe described I feel a bit lighter, and I feel a sense of awe. <br>
I realize how insignificant my worries and problems are. It is not worth letting any negative energy fester within me. <br>
