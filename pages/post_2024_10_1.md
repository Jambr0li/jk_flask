I learned Figma a while ago for UI/UX design. I haven't used it in a while now, but I found a use in my graph theory class. <br>
Here is a 4-dimensional hypercube made in Figma. It also happens to be a 4-regular graph with no 3-cycles as subgraphs:<br>

  .responsive-img {
    max-width: 80%;
    max-height: 200px;
  }
</style>
