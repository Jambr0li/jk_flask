Sometimes I enjoy web development and sometimes I hate it.<br>
I am a person that likes to understand how things work rather than having a heavy reliance on abstractions. I get anxiety when I am writing code that I don't understand. Web develoment is so full of abstractions that making a small web application can take me down a long rabbit hole of figuring out how things work and I end up making little progress.<br>
Then I try taking some shortcuts but those end up slowing me down in the future. <br>
Even though it feels laborious and cumbersome to slow down and figure things out, I think it is worth it in the long run. My code is cleaner and I can operate on it better because I better understand how to interact with it.<br>
